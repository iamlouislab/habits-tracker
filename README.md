# Habits Tracker

Habits Tracker is an open-source iOS application that allows users to track their daily habits. The app is built using Swift and Supabase, a powerful open-source Firebase alternative, which provides backend infrastructure to handle authentification, storage, CRUD operations and a lot of cool stuff.

The application allows users to:

- Sign up and log in using social login providers such as Apple, Google, and Facebook.
- Track their daily habits and view their progress over time.
- Add, edit, and delete habits.
- Upload and view their profile picture using Supabase storage.
